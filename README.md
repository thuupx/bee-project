✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, a Smart, fast and extensible build system.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

## Start the app

To start the development server run `npm run dev`. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/. Happy coding!

## Generate code

If you happen to use Nx plugins, you can leverage code generators that might come with it.

Run `nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [Nx generators on the docs](https://nx.dev/plugin-features/use-code-generators).

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).

## Want better Editor Integration?

Have a look at the [Nx Console extensions](https://nx.dev/nx-console). It provides autocomplete support, a UI for exploring and running tasks & generators, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Ready to deploy?

Just run `nx build demoapp` to build the application. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed.

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/core-features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/core-features/distribute-task-execution)
- [Learn more how to setup CI](https://nx.dev/recipes/ci)

## Start development

### Install dependencies

```bash
brew install protobuf
```

```bash
pnpm install
```

Run microservices locally

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Start all docker compose

```bash
chmod +x ./scripts/*

./scripts/compose-up.sh
```

Incase you have to change proto file for development, just run the following script

```bash
./scripts/generate-proto-ts.sh
```

Incase you have to change prisma schema, just run this script for dev's migration:

```bash
./scripts/prisma-migrate.sh {schema_name} {migration_name}
```

Then all services have been started up, you have to add gateway services and define routes for each service, let's flow these instructions (for now I don't have time to setup the declaration config in kong.conf)

- Open Kong Manager at http://localhost:8002
- Create new gateway service for all microservices (product and account services for example), the host name is local IP address of your machine
- Create new routes for these services
- Create new GRPC gateway plugin: the proto file path is `/usr/local/kong/proto/{file_name}.proto`, this file is symlink of `libs/infrastructure/src/lib/proto/{file_name}.proto`


*This project is under development, so it will have many break changes in the future, I will update the document if I have time.*
